Project Option Chosen:
Open-ended project

Project Description:
I will build an application called Workout Routine Recommendation System. This program will help users receive personalized workout plans based on 
their fitness goals, experience level, available equipment, and workout history. Users will create a profile with their preferences and past workouts, 
and the system will recommend a tailored routine by analyzing their data and matching it with a database of exercises. The application will track user 
progress and allow them to mark workouts as complete, updating future recommendations accordingly.

The code will include abstract base classes for exercises and workout plans, with subclasses for different workout types (strength, cardio, flexibility). 
A recommendation engine will use polymorphism to provide different recommendation strategies. All data and logic will be encapsulated in classes.
