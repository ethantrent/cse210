I am working on a Fitness Tracker console application. The project is designed to help users manage their fitness routines, 
track workouts, and receive exercise recommendations. So far, I have created the main classes from my design, including 
UserProfile, Exercise, ExerciseDatabase, WorkoutPlan, PlanManager, WorkoutHistory, and RecommendationEngine. Each class has 
its methods to represent the intended behaviors, even with some currently empty. The program compiles and runs without errors, 
and there is a basic console menu that allows user interaction, simulating the final workflow of the application. 
This includes options to view exercises, manage workout plans, and update user profiles.
