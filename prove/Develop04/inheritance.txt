1. Explain the meaning of Inheritance

Inheritance is simply the ability to obtain the same attributes and methods of another class.

2. Highlight a benefit of Inheritance

A benefit of using inheritance is being able to use the same attributes and methods of relating classes
so you don't have to rewrite them over and over, advocating for the DRY principle.

3. Provide an application of Inheritance

For example: if I were to create a class called "Animals" and added attributes such as color, age, and name,
I could use inheritance to apply these attributes and methods to different animals. Tortise, otter, and slow loris 
all could inherit the same attributes and methods from a base class called "Features" to describe the animal.

4. Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote
