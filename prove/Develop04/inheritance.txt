1. Explain the meaning of Inheritance

Inheritance is simply the ability to obtain the same attributes and methods of another class.

2. Highlight a benefit of Inheritance

A benefit of using inheritance is being able to use the same attributes and methods of relating classes
so you don't have to rewrite them over and over, advocating for the DRY principle.

3. Provide an application of Inheritance

For example: if I were to create a class called "Animals" and added attributes such as color, age, and name,
I could use inheritance to apply these attributes and methods to different animals. Tortise, otter, and slow loris 
all could inherit the same attributes and methods from a base class called "Features" to describe the animal.

4. Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote

// Base class
abstract class Activity
{
    private string _name;
    private string _description;
    private int _duration;

    public Activity(string name, string description)
    {
        _name = name;
        _description = description;
    }

    public abstract void RunActivity();
}

// Derived class
class BreathingActivity : Activity
{
    public BreathingActivity() : base(
        "Breathing Activity",
        "This activity will help you relax by walking your through breathing in and out slowly. Clear your mind and focus on your breathing."
    )
    {
    }

    public override void RunActivity()
    {
        // Specific implementation for breathing activity
    }
}

This example shares common code between all activities and add new activities by inheriting from the base class
